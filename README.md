# **Deprecation notice**

**EarthModels.jl is wholly replaced by [SeisModels.jl](https://github.com/anowacki/SeisModels.jl).**

EarthModels.jl will continue to work, but will not be updated in the future.

## What is EarthModels.jl?
A [Julia](http://julialang.org) package for dealing with models of the Earth's
(and other quasi-1D planets') seismic properties.

Currently, only three kinds of one-dimensional models are supported, but all model
parameterisations and models are acceptable for inclusion.  Contributions
are welcome.

Built in models are PREM and AK135.


## How to install
Although not registered as an official package, EarthModels.jl can be added to your
Julia install like so:

```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add("https://github.com/anowacki/EarthModels.jl")
```

(On version 0.6 of Julia, instead use the command `Pkg.clone("https://github.com/anowacki/EarthModels.jl")`.)


## How to use
### Model types
The module defines the EarthModel type and subtypes of this specify the kind of
model (i.e., symmetry, nature of basis function, etc.).

```julia
julia> using EarthModels

julia> subtypes(EarthModel)
1-element Array{Any,1}:
 EarthModel1D

julia> subtypes(EarthModel1D)
3-element Array{Any,1}:
 LinearLayeredModel
 PREMPolyModel
 SteppedLayeredModel
```

So, there are currently three types of models implemented, all 1D models, with
polynomial, linear or constant basis within each layer.

### Calculating properties

You can either create your own models by creating a new instance of one of the
immutable types, or use the inbuilt models.  For instance, for PREM, one can
evaluate at an arbitrary radius:

* *V*<sub>P</sub>
* *V*<sub>S</sub>
* density *&rho;*
* anisotropic parameters *V*<sub>PH</sub>, *V*<sub>PV</sub>, *V*<sub>SH</sub>,
  *V*<sub>SV</sub> and *&eta;*
  
Calculate these by calling the function with the model as the first argument:

```julia
julia> vp(PREM, 3500)
13.71171655163979

julia> Qκ(PREM, 1000)
1327.7

julia> density(AK135, radius(AK135, 20))
2.449
```

In the last example, we used the `radius` function to convert depth in the AK135 model
to radius and calculate the density at 20 km depth.  Some functions also accept the
`depth` keyword argument to instead evaluate properties at a point below the surface:

```julia
julia> density(AK135, radius(AK135, 20)) == density(AK135, 20, depth=true)
true
```

You can also evaluate values programmatically (i.e., where the parameter of
interest is a variable) by using the exported `evaluate` function, and broadcast
the call to get multiple values:

```julia
julia> evaluate(AK135, :vp, 3580)
13.653094354838709

julia> parameters = (:vp, :vs, :density);

julia> evaluate.(AK135, parameters, 3680)
(13.591187999999999, 7.226264, 5.4003499999999995)
```

### Model input and output
Support for reading and writing model files is currently limited.  However, EarthModels
does support reading and writing of
[Mineos](https://geodynamics.org/cig/software/mineos/)-format &lsquo;tabular&rsquo; models
(i.e., `SteppedLayeredModel`s) via the `read_mineos` and `write_mineos` functions.

## Getting help
Types and methods are documented, so at the REPL type `?` to get a `help?>`
prompt, and type the name of the function:

```julia
help?> PREMPolyModel
search: PREMPolyModel

  PREMPolyModel <: EarthModel1D

  Type describing the Earth as a set of layers within which properties vary according to a set of
  polynomials.

  Physical parameters are represented by arrays of size (order+1,n), where n is the number of
  layers, and order is the order of polynomial which is used to represent the parameter. Hence a
  constant layer has size (1,n), and to compute the value of x in layer i, for an Earth radius of
  a km, at a radius of r km, the expression is:

  val_x = x[i,1] + (r/a)*x[i,2] + (r/a)^2*x[i,3] ... (r/a)^order*x[i,order+1]

```
